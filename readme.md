# x264-benchmark

A simplified benchmark for video encoding performance, specifically designed for 1080p and 720p live streaming, e.g. to Twitch.

## usage

The easiest way to run the benchmark is to just run the bare image:

```
docker run --rm -v $PWD/bench:/output -it ghcr.io/philippevienne/x264-benchmark:latest
```


By default, the ffmpeg `-threads` parameter will be set to half the number of logical CPU cores available to docker. This is designed to approximate how much processing power you'd be able to give to x264 if you were performing encoding on the same machine as the game or application you are streaming.

You can override this by setting the `THREADS` environment variable, e.g. to `0` to use all cores, but keep in mind that if you are using the encoding PC for other tasks (especially playing games), you should not expect to use all cores for encoding.

```
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD/bench:/output -e THREADS=0 ghcr.io/philippevienne/x264-benchmark:latest
```


## interpreting output

The benchmark encodes a 10-second action clip from 3DMark Skydiver at 6000K ([Twitch's maximum recommended bitrate](https://stream.twitch.tv/encoding/)) and at various resolutions, framerates, and presets. It then outputs the encoding speed as a multiple of framerate. This is meant to indicate how likely your system will be able to encode at those settings.

Combinations that can run in < 10s should be safe to stream at.

Here's some sample results from an i7 8700k utilizing all cores (THREADS=0):

```

 For reference, the source file is 1920x1080 @ 120fps x265 (not x264) crf=23 (approx. 22,700K).
